# Kate LLM Desktop Client - Debugging Status Notes

## Current Status (2025-08-18 14:05 UTC)

Recovery cycle successful: application launches, renders, and shuts down cleanly (loop stop handled). Previous hanging & screenshot rendering hypotheses superseded by confirmed good launch with updated event loop & deferred heavy imports.

### ✅ Resolved Since Prior Notes

1. Startup Hang: Eliminated by lazy-loading heavy ML imports & qasync integration.
2. Shutdown RuntimeError: Caught benign "Event loop stopped before Future completed" and suppressed.
3. Timezone Warnings: Replaced naive `datetime.utcnow()` with `now_utc()` helper across models & embedding shim.

### ℹ️ Clarified / Obsolete Items

- Old assumption of remote desktop compositing issue no longer blocking; UI confirmed healthy.
- January-era PySide6 installation blockers obsolete; environment stable.
- Screenshot artifact issue not reproducible after refactor (removed from active risk list).

### Active Focus

| Area                 | Status             | Action                                       |
| -------------------- | ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| Full Test Suite      | Pending            | Run all pytest & log failures                |
| Database CRUD/Search | Partially tested   | Execute async manager tests                  |
| Web Server Smoke     | Pending            | Start server, GET health, WS connect         |
| RAG Pipeline         | Untested this pass | Plan minimal doc→chunk→embed→retrieve test   |
| Alias Strategy       | Implemented        | Add regression test & plan property refactor |

### Key Modified Files (Recent Cycle)

- `app/database/models.py` (timezone defaults, legacy aliases, auto doc hash)
- `app/main.py` (qasync integration, graceful shutdown)
- `app/web_server.py` (restored minimal FastAPI server earlier)
- `app/core/config.py` (legacy fields + extras allowance)

### Diagnostic Commands (Retained Reference)

```bash
# Launch GUI
poetry run python -m app.main

# Run full tests (to be executed next session)
poetry run pytest -q

# Web server quick check
poetry run python app/web_server.py & sleep 2; curl -f http://127.0.0.1:8000/health
```

### Remaining Technical Debts

- Dynamic attribute aliasing (convert to `@property` / explicit fields)
- Health check framework for services
- RAG dependency optionalization matrix documentation
- Consolidated settings UI (deferred)

### Immediate Next Steps

1. Run entire pytest suite
2. Address failures (prioritize database + service integration)
3. Smoke test web server endpoints
4. Draft regression test for alias layer
5. Update docs (status, production plan, debugging) ✅ (this file updated)
