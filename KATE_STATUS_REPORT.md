# Kate LLM Client - Current Status Report

Date: 2025-08-18

## 🎯 Executive Summary

GUI launches cleanly (qasync + PySide6), database model creation tests pass, and backward compatibility shims are in place. Focus shifts from emergency restoration to full test coverage and web server validation.

## ✅ Recently Completed (Recovery Phase)

- Restored GUI launch with graceful shutdown (caught benign loop stop RuntimeError)
- Added `qasync` dependency & integrated async Qt event loop
- Repaired `app/web_server.py` minimal FastAPI server (earlier pass)
- Implemented timezone-aware timestamps (`now_utc()`) replacing `datetime.utcnow()`
- Added legacy attribute & settings compatibility (tests no longer fail on missing fields)
- Auto-hash & word count calculation for documents; embedding shim stabilized
- Clean run of targeted database model creation tests (all passing)

## 🧠 RAG Backend (Snapshot)

Large multi-service RAG stack remains present; not fully exercised in the latest recovery cycle. Core services (retrieval, embedding, document processing, evaluation, vector store, integration orchestrator) are intact but deferred for comprehensive validation until baseline stability tasks finish.

## 🚧 In Progress / Short-Term Priorities

1. Run full pytest suite (not just model creation tests)
2. Execute async CRUD & search tests for `DatabaseManager`
3. Smoke test web server endpoints & WebSocket
4. Light lint & mypy pass (defer deep cleanup until after functional validation)
5. Update documentation (this report + README + architecture docs) ✅ (current task)

## ⏭️ Next After Baseline Validation

- Re-enable / verify advanced RAG pipeline (embedding model availability, vector store)
- UI polish (assistant panel refresh button, persisted selections)
- Add property-based refactor for legacy attribute aliases (reduce dynamic setattr usage)
- Expand test coverage for service layer (assistant service, provider selection, voice)

## 📊 Current Health Summary

| Area                 | Status | Notes                                        |
| -------------------- | ------ | -------------------------------------------- |
| GUI Launch           | ✅     | Clean start & shutdown (qasync integrated)   |
| Database Models      | ✅     | Creation tests pass; timezone-aware defaults |
| Legacy Compatibility | ✅     | Alias shims in models & settings             |
| Web Server           | ⚠️     | Previously fixed; needs fresh smoke test     |
| Full Test Suite      | ⏳     | Only subset executed so far                  |
| RAG Services         | ⏳     | Present; not recently exercised              |
| Voice / Multimedia   | ⏳     | Not a blocker for current milestone          |
| Lint / Type Check    | ⏳     | Deferred pending functional stabilization    |

## 🔍 Open Risks / Watchlist

- Hidden regressions in un-run tests
- Dynamic attribute aliasing could mask future schema migrations
- RAG stack drift (dependencies, configuration) due to recent focus elsewhere

## 🛠️ Immediate Action Plan (Next Work Session)

1. Run full pytest -> catalogue failures
2. Patch failing async CRUD tests (if any)
3. Launch web server & verify health/WS
4. Commit & tag recovery milestone

## 🗓️ Historical Note

Earlier January 2025 status references (PySide6 install blockers, multimedia issues) are obsolete—environment and GUI issues have been resolved in August 2025 recovery.
